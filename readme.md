## This interactive tool has been developed for ACME to explore an example CDC Strategy and is intended to provide the following:

- Familiarisation of the CDC Strategy structure and how the Stakeholder Intent informs the services that form the CDC Service Catalogue, which in turn informs the People, Process and Technology required to support the services.
- Example Stakeholder Intent 'items' (Key Drivers, Vision, Mission Statement, etc.).
- An example CDC Service Catalogue, including a set of potential CDC services organised in a prospective functional structure.
- Example role personas, operational processes and supporting technologies based on the example CDC Service Catalogue.
- An example roadmap to implement and mature the CDC over the next three years.
