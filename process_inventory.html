        <br>This section of the interactive CDC Strategy tool provides an example CDC Process Inventory, based on the services and components of the example CDC Service Catalogue.
        <br>Attendees at the future CDC Strategy Workshop should familiarise themselves with the processes, which may aid the understanding of the proposed CDC services and their components, and consider the equivalent processes and naming conventions in use at CF.
        <br><strong>Note:</strong> The example processes listed should be considered as a starting point to guide process development. In many cases, a number of processes may be combined together or superseded by CF-wide processes. In other cases, services or service components may share common processes. This will be discussed in the CDC Strategy Workshop and in detail in the future CDC Service Design Workshop and deliverable.
