            <br>This section of the interactive CDC Strategy tool provides an example CDC Persona Inventory, based on the services and components of the example CDC Service Catalogue.
            <br>Attendees at the future CDC Strategy Workshop should familiarise themselves with the personas, which may aid the understanding of the proposed CDC services and their components, and consider the equivalent personas and naming conventions in use at CF.
            <br><strong>Note:</strong> The example roles are included on a persona basis. A single individual may be required to perform a number of persona roles, or a single persona role may be delivered by multiple people. This will be discussed in the CDC Strategy Workshop and in detail in the future Governance and Organisational Design Workshop and deliverable.
